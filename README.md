# Project Details

## Disclaimer

This project is **not** official, related, or approved by Orangetheory in any way. This is a 3rd party project that exists just to get more analysis and information out of the data that you generate during an Orangetheory class (ie, your own data).

## Security

This project does **not** and **will not** collect or track your data in any way. All sign-in credentials and requests are sent directly to official OTF servers; no data provided or retrieved from OTF is ever persisted, saved, or viewed by anybody but you. This project **does** look at which pages are viewed (ie Trends, Class history, etc) in order to watch for errors that occur so I can fix them, but **no personal data** is ever viewed or saved by this.

## Limitations

Since this project is based on reverse-engineering, certain aspects may be buggy or not available. I'll try to update this to provide more functionality, but there are limitations based on the data that is available.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. All contributions should be done through pull-requests and will be code-reviewed to ensure maintainability and to ensure the privacy statement above is maintained.
